<br>

‚ùì **Why?**
-
<br>

I initially started this as a mini-project with the goal of creating 1-2 games to deepen my understanding of coding specifically Python as I'm a beginner. What was meant to be a learning experience quickly grew into something much more significant. As I encountered new challenges and learned more, the project quickly snowballed to around 2,000 lines of code, and I expect it to reach 2,200 to 2,500 lines once I‚Äôve worked through some bugs.

<br>

üìö**What did I learn?**
-

* As this was my first major project, I learned the importance of writing clear comments and conducting thorough research (i.e., good Googling skills).
* Gained a deeper understanding of key Python modules, including os, csv, numpy, sys, threading, and pandas.
* Expanded my knowledge of data structures, algorithms(Not advanced time complexity yet tho), and overall python functions.

üöÄ**How to Run**
-
1. Download the build file
2. Run dist
3. Run Fortune_Finder_.02.exe

‚ö†Ô∏è **IF THIS DOESN'T WORK**
-
It is likely that the issue stems from either the CSV file or recent compatibility problems with numpy and pandas in Visual Studio Code (VSC) when i built the file. For context, I have been developing this project in the sandbox environment on CodeHS. However, when I transfer the code into VSC, the IDE fails to recognize the numpy and pandas modules, despite both being installed via pip.
<br>
<br>
üõ†Ô∏è How to fix
<br>
1. Copy and paste the source code into any Python 3-compatible code editor.
2. Add a file named bank.csv in the same directory.
3. Create the following columns in the CSV file: "name, credits, net profit/loss".
4. Add a row with example values, such as "example, 123, 0".
5. Save the file and run the code.
