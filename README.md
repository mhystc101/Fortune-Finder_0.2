**Why?**

<br>

I initially started this as a mini-project with the goal of creating 1-2 games to deepen my understanding of coding. What was meant to be a learning experience quickly grew into something much more significant. As I encountered new challenges and learned more, the project quickly snowballed  to around 2,000 lines of code, and I expect it to reach 2,200 to 2,500 lines once Iâ€™ve worked through some bugs.

**How to Run**
-
1. Download the build file
2. Run dist
3. Run Fortune_Finder_.02.exe

**IF THIS DOESN'T WORK**
-
It is likely that the issue stems from either the CSV file or recent compatibility problems with numpy and pandas in Visual Studio Code (VSC) when i built the file. For context, I have been developing this project in the sandbox environment on CodeHS. However, when I transfer the code into VSC, the IDE fails to recognize the numpy and pandas modules, despite both being installed via pip.

<br>
How to fix
<br>
1. Copy and past source code into any code editor (Python 3)
2. Add a file named "bank.csv"  
3. Add these three columns: "name,credits,net profit/loss" into the csv
4. Add one row under with anything, ex: "example,123,0"
5. Save and run file.
